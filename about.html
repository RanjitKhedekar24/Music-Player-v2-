      <p>
        Since its launch in 2008, Spotify has revolutionised music listening.
        Our move into podcasting brought innovation and a new generation of
        listeners to the medium. In 2022, we took the next leap, entering the
        fast-growing audiobook market—continuing to shape the future of audio.
        Today, more listeners than ever can discover, manage and enjoy over 100
        million tracks, nearly 7 million podcast titles, and 350,000 audiobooks
        a la carte on Spotify. We are the world’s most popular audio streaming
        subscription service with more than 678 million users, including 268
        million subscribers in more than 180 markets.
